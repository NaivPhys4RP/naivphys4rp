Perception as [inner realistic world construction](https://github.com/NaivPhys4RP/belief_state/) that anticipates and [explains](https://github.com/NaivPhys4RP/inverse_simulation/) the world state as well as observations in an explainable manner, with reasonable computational resources.

The principle is illustrated by the figure below:
